There are some bugs in the code which I couldnt understand and couldnt find a solution

In the first version I was using the "onkey" method with Screen().listen() method so that 
my turtle's listens to my press from the keyboard and acts the input function that I give 
but when I press arrow keys to move it I needed to press the keys repeatedly so that it continues to move
now instead I am using the "onkeypress" method which you dont need to press repeatedly, 
just press untill you want it to stop 

And second important problem was ,when the ball hits the paddles it was bouncing repeatedly since
the if statements still valid because it was still in those limited area,  this might not be the best solution but
I found it useful to just make paddles smaller now I know it s bit hard to play but at least the ball doesnt bouncing continuously 
as far as I see : )
